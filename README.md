## What is CAPTCHA?
--------

**CAPTCHA** is an acronym for the “Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart”. A CAPTCHA test is designed to differentiate if an online user is really a human or an automated user, such as a bot. Although they are designed to block bots, CAPTCHAs are themselves automated. They're programmed to pop up in various websites, and they automatically pass or fail users based on their result to the test. These tests are relatively easier for human users than bots. For example, identifying distorted letters or numbers, or clicking in a specific area.

#### What is the history of CAPTCHA?

CAPTCHA was developed in the early 2000s by Luis von Ahn, David Abraham, Manuel Blum, Michael Crawford, Ben Maurer, Colin McMillen, and Edison Tan at Carnegie Mellon University. The team, led by Luis von Ahn wanted to find a way to filter out the overwhelming armies of spambots pretending to be people. According to him, there are hundreds of different types of CAPTCHAs. He invented another form, the most famous, reCAPTCHA. In reCAPTCHA, instead of a sequence of numbers and letters, he asked people to label the numbers and images taken from books that the computer scanned incorrectly or could not scan. 

#### What is the purpose of CAPTCHA test?

When online applications request client input, CAPTCHAs are usually utilized. Some of the scenarios are listed below:
+ CAPTCHA prevents spams in website comment sections and on blogs where many spammers bombard comment sections with links to increase search engine rankings
+ Many companies offer free email services, but bots would sign up for hundreds of free accounts and then use the accounts to cause havoc online. CAPTCHA tests prevent such misuse of services
+ It offers protection from scrapers who copy the email addresses of valid users. Now, people need to solve a CAPTCHA before an email address is shown
+ Sometimes people don’t want a webpage to be shown so there is an HTML tag that hides the page from robots. CAPTCHA prevents bots from coming through
+ Often people use bots to stuff online polling in favour of certain vote. Usually, IP addresses are recorded to prevent people from voting more than once but with the use of bots one can bypass this policy. CAPTCHA can be used for keeping the integrity of online polling results
+ CAPTCHAs prevent dictionary attacks wherein a computer goes through every word in a dictionary in order to obtain access to user's account details

#### Turning Test – How is it relevant to CAPTCHA Test?

Turing test assesses a computer's ability to mimic human behaviour. A computer program "passes" the test if its performance is indistinguishable from that of a human. A Turing test is not dependent on getting the correct answers, it's about how "human" the answer is, regardless of whether they're right or wrong. 
A CAPTCHA is really the opposite of a Turing test, although its called "Public Turning Test". To accomplish this, a CAPTCHA needs to assign a brief task that humans tend to be good at and computers are not.

#### What are the advantages and disadvantages?

Using CAPTCHA is preferred because: 

1. It is highly worthwhile to discourage spammers and prevent unwanted access 
2. It can stop fake and ill-intended access or usage of legitimate website services
3. CAPTCHAs improve the website’s accessibility
4. They are also very easy to implement or add to an existing website. Thus, ideal for software developers to use

Although the advantages of CAPTCHAs are impressive, it has significant disadvantages that can’t be overlooked. Key disadvantages of CAPTCHA are: 

1. CAPTCHA is not a fool proof tool. It’s most effective for spam and rest of its applications are flawed and highly restricted
2. They only limit spam and is unable to prevent them completely
3. Usually solving CAPTCHA needs time and effort, which is not feasible for every website user. Some might even drop the idea of visiting the website and might lead to a certain drop in website traffic. If the sole purpose of having a website is to generate leads and traffic, CAPTCHA test might become a disadvantage
4. They are not suitable for visually impaired users. So, these audience cannot be considered while using CAPTCHA tests
5. Sometimes CAPTCHAs are difficult for people to understand. Especially audio CAPTCHA and occasionally even texts are illegible

#### What is reCAPTCHA?

**reCAPTCHA** , an advanced version of the traditional CAPTCHA system, is a free Google service that protects websites from spam and abuse by distinguishing human users from automated bots using machine learning and advanced risk analysis. reCAPTCHA is developed by Luis von Ahn, originally released in 2007 and acquired by Google in 2009.

reCAPTCHA verification process uses artificial intelligence (AI) to recognize human behavior that the bots can’t follow.  Eventually, the traditional CAPTCHAs  were replaced with more complex tests in the form of reCAPTCHA v1. reCAPTCHA v2 followed afterward, hoping to provide even more complex tests to deter bots while remaining solvable by human users. The latest version reCAPTCHA v3 aims to avoid disrupting the user experience as this version limits user interaction by calculating a score according to the present user behavior and history.

#### CAPTCHA vs reCAPTCHA

|CAPTCHA|reCAPTCHA|
|--------|-----------|
|older version|newer version|                       
|Controlled by organization or site owners|controlled by google|
|doesn’t change sizes|mostly appears in Google hosted sites|
|submission time limit|no submission time limit|
|more secure than reCAPTCHA for users|google takes lot of user information|

#### How to keep CAPTCHA codes secure?

If CAPTCHA is used to secure websites then developers need to make sure CAPTCHA is protected. Here are viable ways to protect CAPTCHAs:

- Protect the image by slightly distorting before it’s presented to an end-user. This gains immunity from automated attacks.
- By using matchless CAPTCHAs the hackers can’t predict the algorithm being used or the pattern for test creation
- Refrain from using the same sort of CAPTCHA for all the websites for an owner. This increases the predictability for hackers
- Never use common expressions or equations, as it will be easy for hackers to bypass the tests
- Pay attention to the script security. It is important to make sure that images are non-readable for computers and bots by transferring the answer in the form of plain text
- Combine two techniques like text reading and audio recording or image selection and audio description. This makes the tests more complex for the bots
- Use antivirus software as it secures CAPTCHA codes by keeping malicious content at bay
